# Hangman README.md

Developed and designed by Carlosjade "carlosequoia" Mabini, Mark Medrano, Danica Lacap and Erylle Compañero for ITECC02 Finals Project to be defended on November 12, 2025.

Referring to the .java, the hangman is written to be simplistic, objective-oriented and performance optimized. As per code testing, we used IntelliJ IDEA as the IDE. You may run the source code in Visual Studio and may behave the same way.

This prior version of Hangman is written using Java as the main programming language. Parameters and fundamentals used are "basic". This includes `print`, `println`, `if`, `else`, etc.
